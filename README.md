# Brain-Tumor-Classification-Segmentation

# ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to assist in the early detection of brain tumors from MRI images using Deep Learning techniques.
It contains two main parts:

1. Classification â†’ Detects whether an MRI scan contains a tumor or not.

2. Segmentation â†’ Highlights and localizes the tumor region within the MRI scan.



# ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV & NumPy

Streamlit (for interactive web app)

# ðŸ“Š Dataset

Classification dataset: MRI scans labeled as Tumor / No Tumor.

Segmentation dataset: MRI scans with corresponding tumor masks.


# ðŸš€ Features

âœ” Classifies MRI images into Tumor / No Tumor

âœ” Generates segmentation masks to visualize tumor location

âœ” Interactive Streamlit app with image upload & visualization

âœ” Adjustable threshold slider for segmentation results
